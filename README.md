## Challenge Description

### Global Analysis (presented in the report) :: 40 points
 - Analyze the evolution of pollution in Catalonia over time to determine the best/worst hours and best/worst months of the year in terms of pollution, and explain the periodicity of the rate of certain pollutants in the air. (10 points)
 - Analyze the relationship between altitude and concentration of particles in the air, and present your conclusions in graphical form. (10 points)
 - Analyze the concentration of pollutants in urban, suburban and rural areas, and present your conclusion in graphical form. (10 points)
 - Rank the cities in the dataset according to their level of pollution, and create best-5 and worst-5 lists. (10 points)

### Algorithms (published on the OM using compute-to-data feature) :: 40 points
 - Build and publish an algorithm to predict the average concentration of one pollutant of your choice per month for the next 24 months - on average for all stations. (20 points)
 - Build and publish an algorithm to predict the concentration of one pollutant of your choice for each hour of the day from February 15 to 28 - on average for all stations. (20 points)

### Report (published on the Ocean Market for free public consumption) :: 20 points
 - Introduction - provide background information on the challenge and the problem being solved. (2 points)
 - Methodology - describe the steps taken to analyze the evolution of pollutants and predict their concentration. (5 points)
 - Results - present the findings from the analysis of the evolution of pollutants and the performance of the predictive model. (5 points)
 - Observations and Conclusions - summarize the key observations and draw conclusions based on the results obtained. (5 points)
 - Limitations and Recommendations - identify limitations of the challenge and provide recommendations for future competitions. (3 points)
